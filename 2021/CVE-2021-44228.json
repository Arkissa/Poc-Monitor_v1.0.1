This is also a significant vulnerability that affects the so-called Ghidra reverse engineering tool.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tharindudh/Log4j-Vulnerability-in-Ghidra-tool-CVE-2021-44228","created_at":"2022-07-18T20:33:10Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T20:33:10Z","pushed_at":"2022-07-18T20:33:11Z","stargazers_count":0,"watchers_count":0,"forks_count":0,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"allow_forking":true,"is_template":false,"topics":[],"visibility":"public","forks":0,"watchers":0,"default_branch":"main","score":1},{"id":514092288,"node_id":"R_kgDOHqRtAA","name":"log4j-scan","full_name":"bughuntar/log4j-scan","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bughuntar","id":99727538,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfG4sg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99727538?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bughuntar","html_url":"https://github.com/bughuntar","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bughuntar/log4j-scan","description":"A fully automated, accurate, and extensive scanner for finding log4j RCE CVE-2021-44228","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bughuntar/log4j-scan","created_at":"2022-07-15T01:07:56Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T01:07:56Z","pushed_at":"2022-07-15T01:22:17Z","stargazers_count":0,"watchers_count":0,"forks_count":0,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"allow_forking":true,"is_template":false,"topics":[],"visibility":"public","forks":0,"watchers":0,"default_branch":"main","score":1},{"id":515475941,"node_id":"R_kgDOHrmJ5Q","name":"CVE-2021-44228-Mass-RCE-Log4j","full_name":"cybersecurityresearcher/CVE-2021-44228-Mass-RCE-Log4j","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cybersecurityresearcher","id":108762250,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnuUig","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108762250?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cybersecurityresearcher","html_url":"https://github.com/cybersecurityresearcher","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cybersecurityresearcher/CVE-2021-44228-Mass-RCE-Log4j","description":"CVE-2021-44228 Log4J multithreaded Mass Exploitation tool compatible with URL/IP lists.
