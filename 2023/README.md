## CVE-2023-22475 (2023-01-06T15:15:00)
> Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens prior to sha-fb61290. An attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) can use this to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's trigger history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator. This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken, or view its activation history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For example, an attacker could recover the email address tied to the Canarytoken, or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the creator's network location. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-31113, but affected parameters reported differently from the Canarytoken trigger request. An attacker could only act on the discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens or other Canarytoken creators. Canarytokens Docker images sha-fb61290 and later contain a patch for this issue.

## CVE-2023-22472 (2023-01-09T14:15:00)
> Deck is a kanban style organization tool aimed at personal planning and project organization for teams integrated with Nextcloud. It is possible to make a user send any POST request with an arbitrary body given they click on a malicious deep link on a Windows computer. (e.g. in an email, chat link, etc). There are currently no known workarounds. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to 3.6.2.

## CVE-2023-22467 (2023-01-04T22:15:00)
> Luxon is a library for working with dates and times in JavaScript. On the 1.x branch prior to 1.38.1, the 2.x branch prior to 2.5.2, and the 3.x branch on 3.2.1, Luxon's `DateTime.fromRFC2822() has quadratic (N^2) complexity on some specific inputs. This causes a noticeable slowdown for inputs with lengths above 10k characters. Users providing untrusted data to this method are therefore vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. This issue also appears in Moment as CVE-2022-31129. Versions 1.38.1, 2.5.2, and 3.2.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, limit the length of the input.

## CVE-2023-22466 (2023-01-04T22:15:00)
> Tokio is a runtime for writing applications with Rust. Starting with version 1.7.0 and prior to versions 1.18.4, 1.20.3, and 1.23.1, when configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes the configuration. Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publicly shared folder (SMB). Versions 1.23.1, 1.20.3, and 1.18.4 have been patched. The fix will also be present in all releases starting from version 1.24.0. Named pipes were introduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected. As a workaround, ensure that `pipe_mode` is set first after initializing a `ServerOptions`.

## CVE-2023-22463 (2023-01-04T16:15:00)
> KubePi is a k8s panel. The jwt authentication function of KubePi through version 1.6.2 uses hard-coded Jwtsigkeys, resulting in the same Jwtsigkeys for all online projects. This means that an attacker can forge any jwt token to take over the administrator account of any online project. Furthermore, they may use the administrator to take over the k8s cluster of the target enterprise. `session.go`, the use of hard-coded JwtSigKey, allows an attacker to use this value to forge jwt tokens arbitrarily. The JwtSigKey is confidential and should not be hard-coded in the code. The vulnerability has been fixed in 1.6.3. In the patch, JWT key is specified in app.yml. If the user leaves it blank, a random key will be used. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.

## CVE-2023-22456 (2023-01-03T19:15:00)
> ViewVC, a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories, as a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects versions prior to 1.2.2 and 1.1.29. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.2 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.29 (if they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release lineage should implement a workaround. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed paths during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format "html"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.path]` will become `[format "html"][changes.path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else changed path names will be doubly escaped.)

## CVE-2023-22454 (2023-01-05T20:15:00)
> Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, pending post titles can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. Pending posts can be created by unprivileged users when a category has the "require moderator approval of all new topics" setting set. This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourseâ€™s default Content Security Policy. A patch is available in versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16.

## CVE-2023-22452 (2023-01-02T20:15:00)
> kenny2automate is a Discord bot. In the web interface for server settings, form elements were generated with Discord channel IDs as part of input names. Prior to commit a947d7c, no validation was performed to ensure that the channel IDs submitted actually belonged to the server being configured. Thus anyone who has access to the channel ID they wish to change settings for and the server settings panel for any server could change settings for the requested channel no matter which server it belonged to. Commit a947d7c resolves the issue and has been deployed to the official instance of the bot. The only workaround that exists is to disable the web config entirely by changing it to run on localhost. Note that a workaround is only necessary for those who run their own instance of the bot.

## CVE-2023-22451 (2023-01-02T16:15:00)
> Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password canâ€™t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, canâ€™t be a commonly used password, and canâ€™t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.
